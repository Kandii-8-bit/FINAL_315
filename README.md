# FINAL_315

## The Jungle Cook Final for N315

This final is supposed to be a CRUD app, firebase is in the project but I got stuck on how exactly to pull data from firebase into the site. The main index pages are static. I began to write a variable for someone to log-in and out on my model.js but got confused as to if that would be a new function inside the app.js. I also tried to make the last two pages of this final viewable without jQuery but all my ideas flopped. I attempted a little bit of adaptiveness but had issues with alot of it not showing or displaying properly. I also had issues thinking about what came first when it comes to back-end meaning when a person logs in does the first screen of the your recipes page pop up or does it take you to create a recipe. Had issues with my SVG's displaying on the browse page, though my social SVG'S display absolutely perfect in the footer. I mainly styled my site to the best of my ability, with flaws in some of the pages. Also, buttons some of them are actual buttons because I though it would be more appropriate for jQuery. I understand view injections more than I did before. I spent more time on the design rather than the functionality on this final. Back-end developing is definitely a thing that I'm still trying to grasp.
